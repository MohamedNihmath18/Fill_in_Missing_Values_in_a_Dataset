<h1>Fill in Missing Values in a Dataset</h1>
This project is about handling missing values in a dataset using Python.

<h1>What this notebook does</h1>
1.Reads a CSV dataset with missing values.
2.Shows how many missing values are in each column.
3.Fills in the missing values using different methods:
4.Filling with mean (average) of the column.
5.Filling with median (middle value).
6.Filling with mode (most common value).
7.Forward fill (copy the value from the row above).
8.Backward fill (copy the value from the row below).
9.Shows the final dataset after filling the missing values.

<h1>Why it's useful</h1>
Many real-world datasets have missing or empty values. This notebook helps you learn how to fix those missing parts so your data is clean and ready to use.

<h1>Requirements</h1>
You need to have these Python libraries installed:
* pandas
* numpy

You can install them by running:
pip install pandas numpy

<h1>How to run</h1>
1.Open the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2.Run the cells one by one.
3.Youâ€™ll see the missing values and how they are filled.
