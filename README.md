<h1>Fill in Missing Values in a Dataset</h1>
This project is about handling missing values in a dataset using Python.

<h1>What this notebook does</h1>
1.Reads a CSV dataset with missing values.<br>
2.Shows how many missing values are in each column.<br>
3.Fills in the missing values using different methods:<br>
Filling with mean (average) of the column.<br>
Filling with median (middle value).<br>
Filling with mode (most common value).<br>
Forward fill (copy the value from the row above).<br>
Backward fill (copy the value from the row below).<br>
9.Shows the final dataset after filling the missing values.<br>

<h1>Why it's useful</h1>
Many real-world datasets have missing or empty values. This notebook helps you learn how to fix those missing parts so your data is clean and ready to use.

<h1>Requirements</h1><br>
You need to have these Python libraries installed:<br>
* pandas<br>
* numpy<br>

You can install them by running:<br>
pip install pandas numpy<br>

<h1>How to run</h1><br>
1.Open the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.<br>
2.Run the cells one by one.<br>
3.Youâ€™ll see the missing values and how they are filled.<br>
